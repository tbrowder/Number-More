Find font glyph codes for subscript chars for base number:
  base 2..91

Possible future features
========================

IMPORTANT use sets instead of (or in addition to) tokens

handle real numbers (i.e., signed and fractional)

allow addition and subtraction between two numbers with different bases (as
  long as no negative number will result)
  (note that Perl 6 already allows that between decimal, octal, binary,
  and hexadecimal numbers)

handle bases 37 through 62 (and possibly variants, see Wikipedia) [DONE] 

add named param to add 'base-X' to a transformed number (position?)

add bases higher than 62 with named digit sets

allow user-defined digit sets

add a Number class with defined operators +, -, div, mod, /, %, **, *
